### Critical Marketing Issues with Supabase/Firebase

#### 1. **Server-Side Tracking** (CRITICAL)
Modern browsers block client-side pixels (ad blockers, Safari ITP, Firefox ETP).

- **Custom Backend**: ‚úÖ Server-side events ‚Üí 95-100% tracking accuracy
- **Supabase/Firebase**: ‚ùå Client-side only ‚Üí 60-70% tracking accuracy (30-40% data loss!)

**Impact**:
- You're spending $1000 on Google Ads
- 30% of conversions not tracked
- Google thinks ROI is bad
- Waste money on ads

#### 2. **Facebook Conversion API** (VERY IMPORTANT)
Facebook requires server-side events for accurate attribution.

- **Custom Backend**: ‚úÖ Send events from server ‚Üí accurate attribution
- **Supabase/Firebase**: ‚ùå Workarounds complex ‚Üí poor attribution

**Impact**:
- Facebook can't track conversions properly
- Can't optimize ads
- Waste ad budget

#### 3. **Advanced Attribution** (IMPORTANT)
Multi-touch attribution (first click, last click, linear).

- **Custom Backend**: ‚úÖ Build custom models
- **Supabase/Firebase**: ‚ùå Stuck with basic attribution

**Impact**:
- Don't know which channels work
- Misallocate marketing budget

#### 4. **Custom Audiences** (IMPORTANT)
Build retargeting audiences based on behavior.

- **Custom Backend**: ‚úÖ Send custom events to Facebook, Google
- **Supabase/Firebase**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder, requires workarounds

**Impact**:
- Less effective retargeting
- Lower ROI on ads
